## Introduction to data structures

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, 
so that it can be used efficiently.

we will talk about data structures as:

* Mathematical/Logical models or Abstract Data Type (ADT)
* Concrete Implementation

## List

**ADT**

- empty list has size 0
- Insert
- remove
- count
- Read/modify element at a position
- Specify data type

**Implementation**

### Array

If list is **full of array**, create a larger array of **double size of the previous array** and copy all the elements from the previous array into the new array, then free the memory for the previous array.

### LinkedList
