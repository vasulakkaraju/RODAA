## Introduction to data structures

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, 
so that it can be used efficiently.

we will talk about data structures as:

* Mathematical/Logical models or Abstract Data Type (ADT)
* Concrete Implementation

## List

### ADT

- Empty list has size 0
- Insert --- O(n) | Add --- O(n)
- Remove --- O(n)
- Count --- O(1)
- Read/Modify element at a position --- O(1)
- Specify data type

### Implementation

#### Array

If list is **full of array**, create a larger array of **double size of the previous array** and copy all the elements from the previous array into the new array, then free the memory for the previous array.

#### LinkedList

Get the address of the first node and treasure hunt.

#### Comparison
